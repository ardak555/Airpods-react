          The Apple-designed H2 chip is the force behind the advanced audio
          performance of AirPods Pro, working with the driver and amplifier to
          create crisp, high-definition sound. It uses computational algorithms
          to deliver noise cancellation, superior three-dimensional sound, and
          efficient battery life â€” all at once.
